# gfxmixer
A tool for combining SMW GFX pages.

===

# SETUP
If it doesn't already exist, create a folder named **gfx**.
Extract the graphics from your hack from Lunar Magic and copy the contents of the **Graphics** folder into **./gfx/**.
The gfx files should all be named GFX00.bin, GFX01.bin, ... GFX33.bin. (Technically only the sprite ones are required)
